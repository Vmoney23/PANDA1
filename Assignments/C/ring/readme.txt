Readme for part A:

Files: ring.h, ring.c, history.c

I made a program that emulates a basic web-browsing cache using a doubly linked ring list. It shows you the websites you visited in reverse chronological order (latest first) and allows you to navigate between the links. This is done incrementally to show that both shift functions work correctly. The user can also delete links from their history (as you can in a real browser) and print the number of links still stored. Additionally, the user can print out all the links stored, starting from the latest backwards in chronological order.
