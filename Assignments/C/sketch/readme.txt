I'm using a Macbook so SDL2 hasn't been drawing out the files correctly, and in some cases at all. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why that was before giving up and continuing with just the tests.

I got all the way through all the tests up until stage 4. Stage 4 was difficult for me to wrap my head around, and I didn't understand what was meant by the extended operand so I wasn't able to complete that.

The assignment was very very time consuming and a big step up from the last few so I, along with others, struggled with it. Especially because SDL doesn't work correctly.
