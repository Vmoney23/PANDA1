File: Calculator.c

My intial aim for this program was to create a basic working calculator that stored values and could perform continuous operations to numbers, but I was a little to ambitious with the time I left myself to do the extension, so I cut down my idea to just testing the four main mathematical operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. Unfortunately, I got very bogged down with trying to limit the user's input to one of four number, but the program kept dumping out when I entered a letter so I had to simplify the idea because I couldn't get around the bug. Now my program just lets you try the four different operations, one at a time. If you enter an option that is not valid, it ends the program and asks you to restart and use a valid option (because I couldn't work out how to disallow letters).

To use the program you first tell it if you would like to perform a calculation (based on given options), then which mathematical operation you want to perform (based on given options). For each operation you enter two numbers and then the program calculates a resutl and presents it back to you. I print out the results to allow the user to carry on calculations if they wish, because that was the only way to link the current program to my original goal. I have not implimented a check on the inputs to the final calculations because scanf kept giving me a "segmentation fault" and I couldn't figure out why.
