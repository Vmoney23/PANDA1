- My program passes all the tests. To test, enter "make c" followed by "make test". It works best with N x N patterns.

- The program accepts inputs up to size 100, but that can be increased to any number by editing MAX in life.c (I think). 
My extension allows the user to do n iterations of the pattern, to see what it would look like at a specific n. 
It prints each intermediary pattern along the way as well. 
To use the extension, the user must type "make play" and then follow the instructions. 
To end a pattern, the user must press 'ctrl+d'.

- Copied and adapted my friends code to read in the colony.

- I'd say I'm a competent programmer, but still learning as a debugger, which makes it harder for me to fix my code properly.
